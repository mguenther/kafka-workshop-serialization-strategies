# Kafka Workshop - Serialization Strategies

This repository contains the lab assignment on serialization strategies with Apache Kafka.

## Getting started

In this exercise, you'll be working on a couple of Kafka for JUnit backed integration tests that exercise the correct behavior of basic Kafka components that you have to implement. Don't worry about spinning up a local Kafka cluster - Kafka for JUnit does that for you, so that you can focus on getting the details right of the subject-under-test, the Kafka component that you are going to implement.

You'll find the assignment in file `ASSIGNMENT.md`. If you're stuck, consult either your trainers or - if they are currently busy - take a peek into `HINTS.md`. In some cases though, `HINTS.md` gives away the solution directly, so be careful about that.

Task 2 and 3 should work out of the box. If you want to fiddle around with Avro you first must run 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```
